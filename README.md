# 🔌 LED Pattern Controller with Inversion Feature ✨  
--- 

## 🚀 Overview  
This project is a **Custom LED control system** developed in **Assembly Language**. It allows users to control various LED patterns by toggling switches and includes a unique feature: a **special button** that **inverts the entire LED series**. This interactive and dynamic system is perfect for embedded systems or creating visually engaging projects. 💡

## 🌟 Features  
- **Switch-based LED Control:**  
  Users can toggle multiple switches, each corresponding to a distinct LED pattern. 💡  
- **Inversion Button:**  
  A dedicated button that inverts the current LED pattern, creating a fun and dramatic effect! 🔄  
- **Real-time Operation:**  
  Immediate response to switch inputs for seamless operation. ⚡  
- **Highly Customizable:**  
  Add more patterns or customize inversion logic as needed. 🛠️

## 🛠️ Technical Details  
- **🔤 Programming Language:** Assembly Language  
- **🖥️ Hardware Requirements:**  
  - 📟 Microcontroller (e.g., RISC-V, AVR, or 8051-based boards)  
  - 🔘 Multiple push-button switches for pattern selection  
  - 💡 LEDs to display various patterns  
  - 🔌 Power supply and resistors for LED connections (if required)  

### ⚙️ How It Works:  
1️⃣ Each switch corresponds to a specific LED pattern (e.g., blinking, running lights, etc.).  
2️⃣ When a switch is toggled, the respective pattern is displayed in real-time.  
3️⃣ Pressing the **inversion button** flips the entire series of LEDs, turning ON lights OFF and vice versa.
